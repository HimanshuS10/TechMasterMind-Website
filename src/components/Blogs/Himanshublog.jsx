                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">
                        I'm a 2nd year university student studying software engineering at University of Guelph.
                        I used to have two businesses, one was a marketing agency offering short-form content and
                        the other was an AI Automation Agency. My marketing agency was running pretty well, making around
                        {" "}<u>$500-$700</u> per month. I know it's not a lot, üòÇ.
                    </p>

                    <h1 className="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-mid:text-3xl max-phone:text-2xl max-phone:my-0">What is Tech MasterMind?</h1>


                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">It's a website where I will interview a bunch of
                        <strong> techpreneurs and software engineers </strong>
                        to share their journey on how they become successful and share some advice for someone who wants to
                        do the same.
                    </p>

                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I want to interview techpreneurs, basically
                        founders who
                        started a tech/software company, to see how they got started.</p>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I also want to interview a bunch of <u>9-5
                        developers</u> on
                        how they landed their first job and their journey up to this point.</p>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I feel like there are a lot of myths going
                        around the world.
                        The first being that working a 9-5 job is ruining your life and the second being that it is
                        impossible to get a <u>CS internship</u> in this job market. Now, even I think that getting an
                        internship in this job market is hard, well, at least in Canada.</p>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">This is why I want to interview developers so
                        that current CS
                        students, like me, can have a <u>blueprint to follow</u>, giving themselves a higher chance than
                        others. And as for the first myth, yeah, I don‚Äôt believe that (The effect of social media and how it
                        has changed how we think).</p>

                    <h1 className="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-mid:text-3xl max-phone:text-2xl max-phone:my-0">How I came up with this idea? Why is this a good
                        idea?</h1>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">
                        So, as I mentioned before, I am a 2nd-year university student and many students, including myself, have started working on side projects to add to their portfolios. When I opened VSCode, I had no idea what I wanted to build, so I went to YouTube to do some research. That's when I came across Pat Walls, founder of
                        <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/"
                            className="underline decoration-blue-500" target="_blank"> Starter Story.</a> I was already familiar
                        with Pat and rewatched one of his
                        videos on
                        <u className="underline decoration-blue-500"><a className="editor-rtfLink decoration-dashed"
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wEmB5MapE" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                            target="_blank">"How I Built A $1M Business From This
                            Starbucks"</a></u> and he says ‚ÄúI can turn these questions into a product‚Äù, which sparked
                        the idea for something similar to Starter Story.
                    </p>

                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">This led to the creation of <u>Tech
                        MasterMind</u>, inspired by
                        Starter Story but with my own unique twist. I then had the thought of creating something to guide
                        current CS students, like me, in the right direction and also inspire entrepreneurs to start their
                        own tech companies.</p>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">Now here is the best part I can showcase this
                        project on my
                        portfolio, making it look impressive since I've created something that aims to solve a problem. It's
                        a <strong>win-win</strong>.</p>

                    <h1 className="mt-7 text-4xl font-bold max-mid:text-3xl max-phone:text-2xl max-phone:my-0">Monthly Goal:</h1>
                    <p className="my-7 text-lg md:text-[22px] max-sm:text-base">I got the idea to start Tech MasterMind on July
                        23, 2024, and
                        I'm writing this on the 26th, so there's not much time left this month. My main goal for this month
                        is to complete the development of the website, deploy it online, and post at least 3 blogs. I also
                        aim to set up Google Analytics, although I'm not sure how to do this. I'll hopefully be able to
                        figure it out by searching online.</p>
